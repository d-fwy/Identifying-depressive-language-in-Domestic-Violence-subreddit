"Almost 3 years ago, I was attacked. My best guy friend tried to rape me and when I fought for as long as i could, he ended up beating me. It's a miracle that I didn't die, but I have a lifetime of effects, that I now have to deal with, including PTSD and severe memory loss. I also have seizures now. Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the world, and other times like last night, the pain is so bad the only thing I can do is cry. Even thats painful. Sometimes I wish he would've just killed me. Took it all away but everytime i lost consciousness, he would do everything in his power to wake me up, so when id wake up id see him, just for him to continue kicking, punching, choking or fondling me. Im not suicidal but im not stable either. I hear people on the news who die from this shit everyday and had such amazing jobs and family and hell a life, and me, im unemployed, i don't have a high school diploma (im 20 btw, 17 when it happened) and I feel all alone . The black sheep of my family. So why are the best people with best lifes being taken. Granted I have a great mother, wonderful brother and exceptional boyfriend who helps me, i just feel guilty. Guilty I survived and the pain its brought everyone around me. Including myself. Im just so tired. I hope to wake up soon.",,,,,
"I feel stupid for going back to my ex, but I had nowhere to go during the Coronavirus Quarantine. I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys.
Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe. I’m having weekly visitation with my daughter again now that we don’t have to quarantine anymore!",,,,,

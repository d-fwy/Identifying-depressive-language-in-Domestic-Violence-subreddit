    "## Problem statement \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in domestic violence at incidents home as people are confined to their homes for long periods of time<sup>[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html)</sup>. Research has also found that people suffering from domestic violence are also found to be at higher risk of depression<sup>[[2]](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/07/domestic-abuse-victims-more-likely-to-suffer-mental-illness-study)</sup>. Also, when r/domesticviolence posts, many posts about domestic violence experiences seemingly contain words that indicate depressive feelings. Due to the large number of posts on the r/domesticviolence subreddit daily, authors who suffer from depression may go unnoticed and may not be identified to be offered help. This model seeks to solve this problem by taking a proactive approach to identifying such posts in order to direct help to these authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using two subreddits, r/domesticviolence and r/depression, in which people post about their domestic violence and depression experience respectively, a model will be developed to learn the words that typically exist in posts from r/domesticviolence or r/depression, and predict which subreddit a post should belong in --- ```is_depression``` = 1 for a r/depression post and ```is_depression``` = 0 for a r/domesticviolence post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can then be run on posts extracted from r/domesticviolence. If a post contains enough words indicating depression to be predicted as a r/depression post (```is_depression``` = 1), the authors of these posts can be identified by their user ID. These people, who are at risk of depression, could be identified to mental health support groups who will reach out to offer support and assistance. "

    "## Executive summary\n",
    "\n",
    "From the r/domesticviolence and r/depression subreddits, 998 and 960 posts were collected via json extraction from Reddit's API respectively. These subreddits were chosen as they had dominantly text-based data which was advantageous for NLP and had a high number of posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following which, data cleaning was done to replace null values. Preprocessing was then done on the raw data, which consisted of tokenizing, removing stop words and lemmatizing. From the cleaned and preprocessed data, three key features were retained: words in title (```title```) and words in post (```self_text```). An ```is_depression``` column was added to show if the post was from r/depression (```is_depression``` = 1) or r/domesticviolence (```is_depression``` = 0). Another column (```all_words```) which combined words from ```title``` and ```selftext``` was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA conducted to take a preliminarily look at the top words in each subreddit to verify that there are indeed some similarities in words between both subreddits. The EDA also identified that posts in r/domesticviolence tend to be longer than posts in r/depression. In addition, the data also showed that authors who posted in r/domesticviolence did not post in r/depression, and vice-versa. This gives additional credence to the hypothesis that authors of r/domesticviolence posts showing indications of depression through their posts may go unnoticed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the cleaned data, the feature matrix (X) was created with either ```title``` (words from title), ```post``` (words from post) or ```all_words``` (word from both title and post). The target vector is ```is_depression```). Modeling was done on 3 classification models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, all with either Count Vectorization or TF-IDF Vectorization. The results of the models were assessed based on their performance (accuracy score, ROC AUC score, variance between train and test scores, etc). All of the models outperformed the baseline accuracy score of 0.50. The results are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/bestmodels.png\" alt=\"Best models\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The final production model was determined to be the Multinomial Naive Bayes model + Count Vectorization on the ```all_words``` feature matrix due to its high accuracy, ROC AUC and sensitivity (low Type-II error) scores as well as low variance, which means the model will generalise well on unseen data. In addition, the model was tested on two posts from r/domesticviolence - one containing many words indicating depression and one without words indicating depression. It predicted ```is_depression``` = 1 for the 'depressive' post and ```is_depression``` = 0 for the 'non-depressive' post. This is evidence that the model, in addition to being able to differentiate between r/domesticviolence and r/depression posts, is able to identify posts from r/domesticviolence that contain many words indicating depression, so that mental health groups may reach out to the author. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model is just the tip of the iceberg in the relatively new usage of Natural Language Processing to predict mental health issues<sup>[[3]](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2016/8708434/)</sup>. As the use of social media and discussion sites such as Reddit increases, the need for such tools will become increasingly important, particularly in light of increased domestic violence incidents due to COVID-19. Going forward, there are several things that can be done to improve on this model. For instance, gathering more data (words) to improve model performance, introduce an ```is_suicide``` classification as the EDA revealed words indicating suicidal thoughts in r/domesticviolence posts, and adapting the model to predicting ```is_depression``` in other subreddits where people post about their traumatic experiences (similar to r/domesticviolence).

He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say \"your welcome\" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   \\nI ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven\\'t been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   \\nIt was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that\\'s when I noticed he wasn\\'t simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He\\'s really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn\\'t want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn\\'t and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn\\'t hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish \"on me\" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said \"next time? il be hurting you\" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said \"Your Welcome\" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don\\'t have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I\\'m short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..\\n\\nBut its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn\\'t consent to the bad stuff but I couldn\\'t say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like \"stop noises\". Which he ignored and made it worse.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   \\n\\n\\nI feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn\\'t wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he\\'d hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nToday my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   \\nI\\'m eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and\\xa0learned\\xa0to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.\\xa0 When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally.\\xa0\\n\\nI had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its\\xa0alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. \\n\\nAfter 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.\\nBut when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying\\xa0for,\\xa0you are crying as if I raped you. \\n\\nAfter a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.\\nOnce the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.\\nI tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.\\nIn spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.\\xa0 But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.\\nthey sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.\\n\\nNow I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.\\n But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.\\n\\nPlz just share your thoughts\", 'author_fullname': 't2_1cerrsr4', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': '8 years of abusive marriage', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/domesticviolence', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': None, 'link_flair_css_class': 'm-rd Family Abuse', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_hbjyoc', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'upvote_ratio': 0.95, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 15, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Family Abuse', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 15, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1592532949.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': None, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.domesticviolence', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my life story.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am 30 year old female living in india.

I should learn from his mother.\\xa0 When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its\\xa0alright, just don&amp;#39;t make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.\\nBut when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying\\xa0for,\\xa0you are crying as if I raped you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.\\nOnce the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.\\nI tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.\\nIn spite of him saying don&amp;#39;t come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won&amp;#39;t happen again. Then I got pregnant.\\xa0 But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband&amp;#39;s house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don&amp;#39;t care what you do but you should go back to that house.\\nthey sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.\\n But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Plz just share your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': 'a7a37eae-5cda-11ea-bcf3-0ec4f896afb1', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2s2fr', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#0266b3', 'id': 'hbjyoc', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'icysandhya', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 6, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': None, 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/domesticviolence/comments/hbjyoc/8_years_of_abusive_marriage/', 'parent_whitelist_status': None, 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hbjyoc/8_years_of_abusive_marriage/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 10666, 'created_utc': 1592504149.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'domesticviolence', 'selftext': 'I was scrolling through social media and one of my old friends from high school had posted something concerning so I reached out to them.

If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her.\\xa0\\n\\nAny who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said:\\xa0\\n\\n“The word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means “to speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart…\\\\[s\\\\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection \\n\\nI had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:\\n\\n“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.”\\xa0\\n\\nWith this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!”\\xa0\\n\\nSo, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.\\n\\nBut first, some facts:\\n\\nAccording to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):\\n\\n* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.\\n* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out.\\xa0\\n* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves.\\xa0\\n* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave.\\xa0\\n* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes.\\xa0\\n\\nEven though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage.\\xa0\\n\\nAfter three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother.\\xa0\\n\\nThe dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn’t fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t “living” my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep.\\xa0\\n\\nThat night showed me that he wasn’t abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home.\\xa0\\n\\nWe made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn’t remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn’t know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered.\\xa0\\n\\nThe next morning, on Sunday, he didn’t understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn’t welcome to my parents house and to drop me off.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen I arrived, I told my family we weren’t doing well and I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze… I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn’t home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn’t. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never “ordered” me. She texted me back and said, “get in your car and come home.” I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.\\n\\nI didn’t sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn’t do anything.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nThe next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn’t going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was.\\xa0\\n\\nAt the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn’t get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once.\\xa0\\n\\nI often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it’s easy to get down on ourselves for not being “better” at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It’s hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It’s hard, but it’s possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is:\\xa0\\n\\nLeaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible.\\xa0\\n\\nThere is no perfect way to do it.\\n\\nLeaving abuse is messy.\\xa0\\n\\nIf leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process.\\xa0\\n\\nIt takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise.\\xa0There is life after domestic violence.\\xa0\\n\\nPer usual, I have to say, if you are ready to leave an abusive relationship I STRONGLY encourage you to talk to a trained advocate at a[ local shelter](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help#?page=1) or the[ National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/). A trained advocate is able to help you navigate your personal experiences, resources and obstacles and help you develop the best and safest plan of action.\", 'author_fullname': 't2_4zhniu5k', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Leaving for the Seventh Time', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/domesticviolence', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': None, 'link_flair_css_class': 'new', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_hate94', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 15, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': '[new]', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 15, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1592436593.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': None, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.domesticviolence', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defining moment in my recovery from abuse was reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” by Brené Brown. If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said:\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The word courage comes from the latin word &lt;em&gt;cor&lt;/em&gt; which means “to speak one&amp;#39;s mind, by telling all one&amp;#39;s heart…[s]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE &lt;strong&gt;CHOSE&lt;/strong&gt; TO DO TO ME!”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But first, some facts:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/\"&gt; The National Domestic Violence Hotline&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=\"https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave\"&gt; STAND! For Families Free of Violence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out.\\xa0&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves.\\xa0&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave.\\xa0&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes.\\xa0&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father&amp;#39;s Day celebration for my Dad and Brother.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack.

I have been with my bf for four and a half years, at least two and a half of those have been abusive.  Things really stepped up at the start of the year and with the lockdown the levels of emotional abuse, sexual coercion and the fear of angry moods and threats to sleep with other people have been unbearable.  Things reached a fever pitch a couple of weeks ago after I was coerced into a threesome I had categorically said I did not want to do, after being plied with alcohol and drugs.  I have been really struggling since then.\\n\\nI asked him to leave last Monday after he told me he wanted to sleep with men.  And then I begged him to leave on Tuesday.  He keeps saying that we are a union and will work it out.  He pretended that everything was fine the next two days, telling me over and over how he couldn't wait to spend Friday night with me and to have sex.  Friday night comes around and he smokes a huge amount of weed and ignores me all night, texting and not replying when I talk to him.  It gets to nearly 11pm and I look over at him as he's still texting.  He gets very cross and accused me of giving him dirty looks and asks why.  I explained that I was really upset that he had ignored me all night and broken his work to me yet again, despite promising me that he wanted to fix that.  He made some excuse about it being the lockdown and how the world was different and then told me that I should be happy anyway as he was texting about setting up sleeping with a guy.  I lost it.  I shouted and cried, I told him how if spent hours getting ready, cleaning up, looking nice etc and he looked me up at down in disgust and laughed in my face.  He shoved me across the kitchen at some point and the. Said something I really can't remember and I flew at him, kicked his legs and told him I would like to slit his throat.  It was wrong, I should have kept my temper but I needed him to see just how much pain he has caused me.\\n\\nOf course he flees the house, runs to his friends, tells them all I'm an alcoholic and he's suffering from domestic violence.  He's had me referred to mental health professionals and I've ended up being passed on for an alcohol dependency intervention.  I've explained to every professional what is happening and they are all very understanding but I'm just in turmoil.  I really don't know what to do.

I have been with my bf for four and a half years, at least two and a half of those have been abusive.  Things really stepped up at the start of the year and with the lockdown the levels of emotional abuse, sexual coercion and the fear of angry moods and threats to sleep with other people have been unbearable.  Things reached a fever pitch a couple of weeks ago after I was coerced into a threesome I had categorically said I did not want to do, after being plied with alcohol and drugs.  I have been really struggling since then.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him to leave last Monday after he told me he wanted to sleep with men.  And then I begged him to leave on Tuesday.  He keeps saying that we are a union and will work it out.  He pretended that everything was fine the next two days, telling me over and over how he couldn&amp;#39;t wait to spend Friday night with me and to have sex.  Friday night comes around and he smokes a huge amount of weed and ignores me all night, texting and not replying when I talk to him.  It gets to nearly 11pm and I look over at him as he&amp;#39;s still texting.  He gets very cross and accused me of giving him dirty looks and asks why.  I explained that I was really upset that he had ignored me all night and broken his work to me yet again, despite promising me that he wanted to fix that.  He made some excuse about it being the lockdown and how the world was different and then told me that I should be happy anyway as he was texting about setting up sleeping with a guy.  I lost it.  I shouted and cried, I told him how if spent hours getting ready, cleaning up, looking nice etc and he looked me up at down in disgust and laughed in my face.  He shoved me across the kitchen at some point and the. Said something I really can&amp;#39;t remember and I flew at him, kicked his legs and told him I would like to slit his throat.  It was wrong, I should have kept my temper but I needed him to see just how much pain he has caused me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course he flees the house, runs to his friends, tells them all I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic and he&amp;#39;s suffering from domestic violence.  He&amp;#39;s had me referred to mental health professionals and I&amp;#39;ve ended up being passed on for an alcohol dependency intervention.  I&amp;#39;ve explained to every professional what is happening and they are all very understanding but I&amp;#39;m just in turmoil.  I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do.  I just want to believe that he hasn&amp;#39;t done any of this on purpose.  I&amp;#39;ve just spoken to him again about the way he treats me and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what I say, or what I show he finds a way to say it&amp;#39;s somehow my fault.  I feel really broken.

Many of you may be quarantined with an abuser or dealing with their ramped up abuse due to their proximity or need for that outlet. Abusers are coming back from years ago to get to you with hoovers. Being isolated is very hard and this is a situation completely unexpected and anxiety driving in and of itself. So we wanted to put together a listing of resources, many of which are listed in our resource listing in the sidebar for you in this difficult time. Stay safe out there, folks. We are right here with you, and we will get through this together. \\n\\n\\nSupport for Domestic Abuse:\\n\\n* [Thehotline.org]( https://www.thehotline.org/) is available 24/7 for chat and calls (1800-787-3224) during this crisis for women, men as well as LGBTQ folks. Please be sure to use safe electronics to contact them or any agency if an abuser has access to them. They also offer a [Safety Planning]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/for-yourself/safety-planning/interactive-safety-plan/) through [LOVEISRESPECT]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/) which is also available 24/7. \\n\\n\\n* [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) is still operating their crisis lines 24/7 along with chat capabilities. They can be there for sexual assault victims. \\n\\n* [1in6]( https://1in6.org/) is a resource for men who have been abused/sexually assaulted. They are available right now with weekly support group online meetings in addition to a 24/7 chat line. They work with [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) for a resource just for men. \\n\\n* [SurvivorsUK]( https://www.survivorsuk.org/) is there for male rape and sexual abuse victims 12PM-8PM in the UK. \\n\\n* [CODA]( https://coda.org/) runs online support groups for people struggling with Codependency. They have physical meetings in many places in normal times, but have a number of online support groups for those needs. \\n\\n* [HOTPEACH]( https://hotpeachpages.net/) is a site where they direct you to services for domestic abuse internationally. It’s a great resource for non-US resources. \\n\\n* [DomesticShelters]( https://www.domesticshelters.org/) is a resource to help you locate shelters and resources. They also have online support groups. \\n\\n* [FAMILY SANCTUARY]( https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/safety-planning-covid19/) offers safety planning direction and support. \\n\\n* [REDROVER]( https://redrover.org/news/coronavirus-covid19/) helps with safety planning for your pets and resources. \\n\\n* [LGBT Foundation]( https://www.lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/domestic-abuse) is still working to provide you with services during this stressful time to the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nResources For Suicide Hotlines (Please dial emergency services if you are a threat to your safety):\\n\\n* [SUICIDEWATCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=NarcissisticAbuse&amp;utm_content=t5_2ys1m) is the sub at Reddit that has the listings of suicide hotlines and organizations there to help you in your time of need. It’s a vast listing with an FAQ.
